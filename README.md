# Introduction 

This folder contains the source code used in the paper “The Terminator: An Integration of Inner and Outer
Approximations for Solving Regular and Distributionally Robust Chance Constrained Programs via Variable Fixing.” By variable fixing, the paper integrates inner and outer approximations for solving chance constrained programs. To successfully run the code in subfolders, you may need to install Python (i.e. .py files).

Below is a detailed explanation of each subfolder.

# Subfolder: Section 6
**Asymptotic Theoretical Analysis of Variable Fixing.**
* **Purpose:**  Conduct an asymptotic analysis to determine the proportion of scenarios whose corresponding binary variables can be fixed to zero.
* **Source code info:** The code folder includes four.m files. They are used to reproduce the results in Section 6.

# Subfolder: Section 7
**Numerical Study of Variable Fixing.**
* **Purpose:** Demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.
* **Source code info:** The code folder includes five .ipynb files. Each case has one code for implementation (Case I, Case II, Case III, Case IV, and the comparison case in Appendix C).


Feel free to refer to the codes displayed in the subfolders. If used in your research, please cite our paper.
