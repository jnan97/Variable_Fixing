# Introduction 

This folder contains the source code (i.e., .py files) used in the paper “ALSO-X is Better Than CVaR: Convex Approximations for Chance Constrained
Programs Revisited.” The paper proposed two algorithms, termed "ALSO-X" and "ALSO-X+," to solve CCPs and DRCCPs with subfolders Experiment 1-2.  To successfully run the code in subfolders, you may need to install Python (i.e. .py files).

<!-- .  and DRCCPs, corresponding to subfolders Experiment 1-2 and subfolders Experiment 3-4. To successfully run the code in subfolders, you may need to install Python (i.e. .py files) and Matlab (i.e. .m files). -->

Below is the detailed explanation of each subfolder.

# Subfolder: Experiment 1
**Testing in CCPs.**
* **Purpose:**  Experiment 1 was implemented to test the performance of ALSO-X and ALSO-X+ for solving regular CCP. 
* **Source code info:** The code folder includes two .py files. "Linear CCP. py" and "Nonlinear CCP. py" are the codes for implementations in linear and nonlinear CCP, respectively.

# Subfolder: Experiment 2
**Comparisons in Covering CCPs.**
* **Purpose:** Experiment 2 was implemented to compare CVaR approximation, ALSO-X, ALSO-X+, and Relax-and-Scale Algorithm for solving covering CCPs.
* **Source code info:** The code folder includes one .py file. "Covering CCP. py" is the code for implementation.

<!-- # Subfolder: Experiment 3
**Testing in DRCCPs.**
* **Purpose:** Experiment 3 was implemented to test the performance of the worst-case ALSO-X and the worst-case ALSO-X+ for solving DRCCP. 
* **Source code info:** The code folder includes three .py files. "1 Wasserstein with 2 norm. py" and "1 Wasserstein with 2 norm & tuning. py" are the codes for implementations in DRCCP with 1-Wasserstein ambiguity set with 2-norm and the penalized version to improve the worst-case ALSO-X. "infinite Wasserstein with infinite norm. py" is the code for implementations in DRCCP with infinite-Wasserstein ambiguity set with infinite norm. 

# Subfolder: Experiment 4
**Illustration Example in a DRCCP with Gaussian Reference Distribution.**
* **Purpose:** Experiment 4 was implemented to illustrate the comparisons in a DRCCP with Gaussian reference distribution.
* **Source code info:** The code folder includes three .m files.  "eta_theta. m", "eta_epsilon. m", and "eta_comparison. m" are the codes for discussions in Figure4, Figure 5, and Figure 6, respectively.
